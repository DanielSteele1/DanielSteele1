I'm Daniel Steele, a Full Stack Developer in my final year of Computer Science(BSc Hons) at the University of Plymouth.

I build full stack web applications using the MERN Stack. 
In my course, I have also tinkered with C++ to create console based games, and used OpenGL to create different scenes and environments.
